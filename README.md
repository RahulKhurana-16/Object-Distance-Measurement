# Object Distance Measurement

Distance measurement between a robot and the object is needed to control the action of the robot such as grabbing an object or even avoiding obstacles. There are many methods to estimate the distance such as ultrasonic ranging, laser ranging, and vision based ranging. Vision based techniques have the merit of its low cost, so in this project, I build a model that could be used for distance measurement between a camera and a circle marker with over 90% accuracy.
